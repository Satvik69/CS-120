# CS-120
One common theme that I would like to point out is the evolution in my MIPs Assembly coding. Earlier labs had randlomly thrown code together. Then, we began to use functions and call them. Finally, we started using the stack and stored temporary variables there to streamline the process.

Writing in Assembly was a unique but fun challenge. It was also very rewarding because I had to use a lot more logic than before. This language made me realize how the computer is not as smart as we think it is. Every bit of data needs to be fed procedurally and keeping track of the registers is impossible for large applications.

Learning this language gave me newfound respect for the man who created Rollercoaster Tycoon.
