# CS-120

My evolution in MIPs Assembly coding:
`Random Code -> Functions -> Stack usage & variables`

A unique and fun class. More intensive than OO languages - data needs to be fed procedurally and keeping track of the registers is impossible for large applications. Learning this language gave me newfound respect for the man who created Rollercoaster Tycoon.
